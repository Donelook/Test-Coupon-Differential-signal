To verify the differential signal theory outlined in Eric Bogatinâ€™s Signal Integrity, Me and Aleksander Kaweczynski(https://blog.aleksander.kaweczynski.pl/pl/) developed a PCB test coupon that isolates and measures key parameters, allowing me to compare real-world data with theoretical predictions. 
We simply check rule of thumb of differential signalns that calls 
"As a rough rule of thumb, when the distance to the return plane is
about equal to or larger than the total edge-to-edge span of the two signal
conductors, the current distributions in the return path overlap, and the
presence of the return path plays no role in the differential impedance of
the pair. In this case, it is true that for a differential signal, the return current
of one signal line really is carried by the other line."
